We have data from a saliency prior elicitation task where people see a message like "Click the dog!" and a set of four pictures, which may include more than one dog. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(jsonlite)
setwd("~/Box Sync/stanford/research/goodman/q&a/PriorsExperiment/")
```

```{r}
totalCounts = read.csv("data/priorsExperiment-trials.csv") %>% 
  group_by(domain,type,label) %>%
  summarize(total = n()) 

proportions = read.csv("data/priorsExperiment-trials.csv") %>%
  inner_join(totalCounts) %>%
  group_by(domain,type,label,response) %>%
  summarize(prop = n() / mean(total))
```

Generate json...

```{r}
json = toJSON(proportions, pretty = T)
write(json,file = "saliencyKnowledge.json")
```
