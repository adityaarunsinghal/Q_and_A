This experiment was run using a version of the submiterator tools developed by Dan Lassiter:

The goal of this experiment was to manipulate the participant's understanding of the intentions behind a question. Each participant saw 4 scenarios, each from a different domain, and rated the appropriateness of different answers. We were interested in whether different kinds of scenarios could systematically change which answers were appropriate.
