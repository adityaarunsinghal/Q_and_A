92	Russian	2	Male	24		Confused	3
93	English	1	Female	29	I wasn&quotechart sure whether I could choose the same questions again... So I think I chose Pet? or Dog? twice.  And I don&quotechart think I understood the game properly because if the same cards are being used, just shuffled around every game/round, what&quotechars the point in having the same four questions? Unless it was meant to be guessed as a whole by the end of the four rounds?  But if that&quotechars the case, why were the Helper&quotechars cards/gates shuffled around after each round?	Confused	3
