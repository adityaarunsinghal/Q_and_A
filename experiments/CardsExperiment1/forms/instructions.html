	<h2><center>Complete the combo!</center>  </h2>

	<p>
	  In this experiment you will play a communication game with a robot partner! 
	</p>

	<p>
	  You will both see a 4 x 4 grid containing cards. For every
	  round of the game, one player (the "seeker") will be given a
	  goal: to find a specific combination of cards in the
	  grid. There will either be 1 or 2 cards in this combo.
	  However, the seeker is trapped in a fog and cannot see
	  where <b>any</b> of the cards are! Thankfully, the other
	  player (the "helper") knows where all the cards are but does 
	  not know which ones the seeker is trying to find.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/cardViews.png" alt="Example objects"
		 style="width:400px; height:225px">
	  </center>
	</p>

	<p>
	  There are two things you need to know to succeed.
	</p>

	<ol>
	  <li>
	    <b>Both the seeker and the helper can see the list of
	      possible combos</b>. The seeker will see their target
	      combo highlighted in a green box. These are the cards
	      they are trying to find.  The helper knows the seeker is
	      trying to obtain one of the combos in the list but does
	      not know which one.
	  </li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/goalViews.png" alt="Example goals"
		 style="width:400px; height:235px">
	  </center>
	</p>
	<ol start="2">
	  <li>
	    The seeker is able to <b>ask the helper a question</b>
	      about the location of a card. The seeker must use
	      dropdown menus to complete the question: "Where is the
	      ...?"
	    <p>
	      <center>
		<img src="images/message.png" alt="Example objects"
		     style="width:292px; height:102px">
	      </center>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      The helper will then see this question and select up
	      to <b>two</b> cards to reveal by clicking on cards, and
	      then on the 'REVEAL' button when ready. They will need
	      to wait until the seeker has sent a question before
	      being able to click anything.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <center>
		<img src="images/response.png" alt="reveal"
		     style="width:300px; height:349px">
	      </center>
	    </p>
	  </li>
	</ol>	

	<p>
	  On every round, if the seeker asks a good question and the
	  helper carefully reveals the right cards, it is possible to
	  complete the combo in a single exchange. This is how you get
	  the <b>bonus of $0.05 per round</b>. If the combo is not
	  completed after the first question, or if other cards are
	  revealed, you will not receive the bonus, so pay attention
	  to your choices! There are a total of <b>6 rounds</b>, and
	  you will switch roles halfway through. After the final round
	  you will answer a few more questions and be on your way.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Finally, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once
	  you start the game (including the waiting page), or tab away
	  from the page once a partner joins. You not be able to
	  rejoin the game you were in and you may not be able to
	  submit the HIT. <br> Thank you!
	</p>

	<h3>
	  Please fill out this short quiz below before getting
	  started. Be confident you understand the instructions before
	  submitting the quiz -- if you answer incorrectly, you will
	  not be able to proceed to the game.  Good luck, and have
	  fun!
