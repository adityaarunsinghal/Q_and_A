17	English	1	Male	31	I didn&quotechart think either question ("cat?" "dalmatian?") was more helpful than the other.  If I asked "cat?", then I&quotechard know that the other two have dogs, and I have a 50% chance of picking the right dog.  If I asked "dalmatian?," then I&quotechard know that the other two boxes contain the cat and the correct dog, with a 50% probability of guessing correctly.  I made my decision because I&quotecharm looking for a dog, so it felt more natural to ask about the dalmatian even if the dalmatian is not the particular dog I&quotecharm looking for.  	Yes	4
