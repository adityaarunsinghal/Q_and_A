99	English	2	Female	51	On the second part it would have been nice to both know what the person was searching for and what question they asked.  If they were looking for the poodle, and asked for Dalmation, I would show them the Dalmation.. but if they were trying to find the Dalmation, I would have shown them the poodle.  I was just a bit confused by the second part, in that I didn&quotechart have both pieces of information.	Confused	3
