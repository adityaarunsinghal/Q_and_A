	<p> In this experiment, we'll be playing a guessing
	game. The game has two roles, which will be assigned
	randomly. Since you will not know which role you will play
	until the game starts, you will be responsible for
	understanding the responsibilities and goals of both
	roles.  </p>

	<p> If you are the first person to arrive in a game, you must wait
	shortly for another player to join. Once both players have
	joined the game, you will see a display like the
	following: </p>

	<p>
	  <center><img src="images/guesserViewStart.jpg" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:730px;height:367.5px"></center>
	</p>

	<p> On the right side of the screen, you will see a workspace
	filled with various objects and messages. On the left side of the screen,
	you will see a chat window that will contain messages from the
	other player. </p>
	
	<h3> Guesser instructions </h3>

	<p> There are four objects hidden behind four gates. These
	four objects are shown on a wheel. This wheel will spin and
	pick out one of the objects for you to find. For example, if
	it lands on the cat, you must try to guess which gate has the
	  cat behind it. </p>

	<p> If you had to guess without any further information, you
	wouldn't stand much of a chance of finding it. Luckily, you
	are playing with a helper, who knows exactly what is behind
	each gate. You have the opportunity to ask them a single
	question before you guess. Just drag the words in the
	"question box" onto the line to make a question, and then
	  click the 'send' button! </p>

	</p> The helper can 'lift' one of the gates, showing you
	what's behind it. Once you get their answer, you will click on
	one of the green gates to guess where it is. You will then
	find out whether you guessed correctly! </p>

	<h3> Helper instructions </h3>

	<p> If you are the "helper", you will see a different screen,
	shown below. You don't know which object the guesser is trying
	to find, but you know where all of the objects are located!
	You will watch them drag words up to the line in the question
	box and then see their question appear in the left side of the
	screen. Based on this question, you will select one of the
	four gates and click the "send" button. Sometimes their
	question will be vague, making it harder to tell what they're
	looking for, but think about why they might have picked the
	question they did. </p>

	<p>
	  <center><img src="images/helperView.png" alt="helper view" style="width:602.5px;height:298.5px"></center>
	</p>	


	There will be 4 rounds, where the locations of objects are randomly shuffled from round to round. This means that the information the helper gives on one round is completely irrelevant to the locations of items in the next round! Once another player joins, the experiment should take about 7 minutes.
