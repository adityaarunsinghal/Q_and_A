[] switch to random sampling of conditions w/o replacement instead of going through full set of goals
   (worried that there will be stronger order effect if we keep the same alternatives and questions, 
    e.g. people might be reticent to ask the same question twice for different goals, even if it's the best one

PHASE 1:
[x] remove chat box, keep messages panel
[x] draw question box
    [x] draw lighter-colored background in different places for guesser and helper
    [x] create submit button
    [x] read and send sentence that is made
[x] create word objects that are draggable
    [x] draw words inside box (from bottom)
    [x] put boxes around them
    [x] create line that participants must drag the words onto
    [x] snap to this line
    [x] allow them to return to original position
	[x] assign text on word objects based on condition
    [] show "waiting for guesser to ask a question..." message to helper during this phase
[x] draw gates 
    [x] create gates object mapping gate numbers to words
    [x] connect those words to pictures
    [x] do the 'shuffle' thing with a border to make it look random
    [x] highlight the one that's the current goal
    [x] print message like "your goal is..."
    [] change helper display to show "guesser view" vs. "your view" with ?s in guesser view
PHASE 2:
[] display message to answerer like "click a gate to show to the guesser"
[] allow answerer to click on an animal to pick a gate to show
[] translate answerer selection to a sentence that gets posted
PHASE 3:
[] transition question screen to "pick a gate" afterwards
PHASE 4:
[] show true location of objects after they pick

BUGS:
[x] fix alignment problems (i.e. use questionBoxAdjustment)
[] possible bug when screen is resized?
[x] unset boolean when dragged off line
[] weird stuff happens when people try to move the words before the shuffle thing is done

OPTIONAL:
[] center words in box?
[] push out to sides
