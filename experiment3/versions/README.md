We ran several versions of this experiment:

* `experiment3_orig` was the basic "guessing game" task with "where" questions and dropdown menus to respond
* `experiment3_fr` was the same as experiment3_orig, but gave participants a text box for the answerer phase instead of a drop down menu, allowing them to respond freely
* `experiment3_polar` used polar questions instead of "which gate..." questions
* `experiment3_short` was a refined version of `experiment3_orig` driving home the message that the answerer can only give one location of one item. It also fixes other problems in the design of experiment3_orig, like counterbalancing the order of questioner and answer phases, and rewording some sentences in the instructions
* `experiment3_long` made it official that players can give the locations of *all* the dogs, or *all* the animals, etc.
