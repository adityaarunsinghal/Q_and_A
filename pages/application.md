- Vision + language?
  - Assigning informative labels to images?

- Model desiderata
  - It's easy for people to understand why it would be cool to have working inference
  - The model class generally is a good fit for filtering
  - Current techniques don't work very well as the state space grows
  - We have reason to believe that coarse-to-fine can change this
  - For bonus points, coarse-to-fine should seem cognitively plausible for the chosen model

- Datasets
  - [Tiny images dataset](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/TinyImages/)
  - [Abstract scenes dataset](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/larryz/clipart/abstract_scenes.html)

- Open questions
  - What is the vision/scene model?
  - What is the language model?
  - How do the two models interact?
  - How is each of the models coarsened?
